/**
 * Abstract base class for all structural cross section models. It declares commons services provided by all
 * structural cross section models. The implementation of this services is left on derived classes,
 * which will implement cross section model dependent part. However, some general services are
 * implemented here.
 * For information, how to introduce integration points in cross section volume for
 * macro integration point, see @ref CrossSection reference manual.
 *
 * At structural level of cross section or constitutive models are introduced several stress/strain modes.
 * Full and reduced formats of stress/strain vectors are also introduced for convenience.
 * The full format includes all components, even if they are zero due to stress/strain mode nature,
 * but in the reduced format, only generally nonzero components are stored.
 * (full format must used only if absolutely necessary, to avoid wasting of space. It is used
 * by output routines to print results in general form). Methods for converting vectors between
 * full and reduced format are provided.
 * General full strain vector has one of the following forms:
 * -# strainVector3d {eps_x,eps_y,eps_z,gamma_yz,gamma_zx,gamma_xy}
 * -# For integrated cross section models (2d and 3d beams, plates and general shells)
 *    strainVectorShell {eps_x,eps_y,gamma_xy, kappa_x, kappa_y, kappa_xy, gamma_zx, gamma_zy}
